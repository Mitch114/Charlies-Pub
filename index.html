    Charlie Smith is a master in his craft at brewing the perfect beers. He has been in the craft beer business for 15 years, with a menu that includes a select amount of savory appetizers/snacks. Also with a diverse amount of craft beers on tap. He owns his own small pub and has loyal customers, but not a lot of new ones coming in. He needs a website that will represent and show off his beers and pub. It will include information about Charlie and his Pub, craft beers on tap, local events the pub will host to gain more traction and a subscription to emails. The main purpose for this website is to expand the voice of Charlies Craft Pub, and show customers an unforgettable experience.
